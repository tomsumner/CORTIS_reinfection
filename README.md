This code is used to generate the results described in Sumner et al, The effect of new Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection on the sensitivity of prognostic TB signatures, In Review

The analysis estimates the effects of re-infection with M.tb after screening on the observed sensitivity of the CORTIS assay (RISK11) for predicting incident TB in HIV-negative adults. The main CORTIS trial is described in:
